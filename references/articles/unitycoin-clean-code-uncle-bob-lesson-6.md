## Highlights

### How do you manage a software project?

Leads to:

- Producing the wrong product
- Producing a product of inferior quality
- Being late
- Working 80 hour weeks

#### id946365983

> why is it so hard to manage software projects? What is the fundamental cause of this? The answer to that has been known for a very long time, and it’s actually a very simple problem: good, fast, cheap — pick any three; you're not going to get the fourth.

**Initial thought or note on:** [(View Highlight)](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k767mvq148ny9kxa1jg3ze6q)
Lots of feedback - increase iteration cycles (2 weeks most common). Agile is to have multiple short iterations, so to be best informed by having more meaningful communication to help drive the product to what the customer wants without guessing what they want.

### Finding the optimum solution - Data

Finding the optimum solution

- We need to manage the project to the best possible outcome
- An outcome that maximizes all four qualities: good (quality), fast (schedule), cheap (cost), done/scope (the deliverable).
- To do this, we need: DATA!

#### id946366873

Velocity chart. This enables managers to predict the volume of work that can be done within a week.

#### id946367270

> another piece of data that would be really useful, that's a burn down chart. A burn down chart says there's 400, and by 500, isn't it about 500 points remaining until the next major deliverable

**Initial thought or note on:** [(View Highlight)](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k768a1jvn3c641edvpxw9gfq)
One would hope that volume of work would decrement by the average of team's velocity.

This puts process in-front of getting what the customer/end-user requests.

#### id946476213

> But the other possible reason that that bar’s a little bit higher is that the developers looked at the project again They've been wrong, and so they rested, which is perfectly acceptable because their estimates are not promises, and therefore we want to know as soon as the developers realize that, you know, our original estimates for Ignite were a little optimistic. We want to know that as soon as possible, so everybody understands what's happening with this project.

On the topic of burndown charts (story points left in sprint/release) we generally want to see the number of story points decrease; however, there may be a case where one would see a spike in story points.
This may be a point in that an evaluation of an user story was lower than what the work required actually was (i.e. it was more complexed than they originally estimated).

All work has been planned to the next major deliverable. It isn't management saying just do the work it's the whole team on same level understanding what is going on.
This is done every iteration - curate another 3 to 4 months look ahead.

It’s better to have them on the wall because then everybody can see them, and everybody can know how screwed they are.

If every feature is important than none of them are. Core features of each major release can be replanned or deprioritized, and can later be incorporated in the next iteration.

#### id946589875

> why are they going to change all the time? Well, because the customers don’t really know what they want, and the more we talk about what they want, the better idea they kind of get about what they want. But they really don’t know what they want until they see something execute that is not what they want.

Agile is to work in iterations. Ideas get better with iterations. As a result show-and-tell the customers early and often to see if it is in alignment to what they envisioned the end product to be.

### The Waterfall Model

#### id946590014

Software is made to be flexible and dynamic. Major changes can be made relatively quickly.
Other engineering disciplines are not susceptible to such rapid changes; for this reason, waterfall methodologies are better suited.

Break the project up into 3 major phases:

1. Analysis

#### id947984911

**Initial thought or note on:** [(View Highlight)](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k7j3k7epyt6jvq8w3nbrjqzx)
It isn't about doing more of the analysis or design. Requirements changed, so they "hacked" their way into implementation ignoring the original design documentations.

#### id947985278

> In that first sprint, that first iteration, the first two weeks, some people call this iteration zero. What we're doing there is gathering some requirements. Not all of them, because we can't get them all, but we'll talk to the customer a little bit. This is when we're writing use cases or, nowadays, we call them user stories.

The team is making good decisions, there's good communication with the product owners and so on. Everything's going along fine, and then you start to see the team slow down. Thus, the team gets slower and slower with time. Why does this happen? Because they're not practicing the engineering practices. In the middle, the engineering practices are the things that keep the architecture and the design and the code clean, and without that, Scrum will slow down and grind to a halt.
